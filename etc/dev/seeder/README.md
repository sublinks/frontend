# Job Seeder

This is a script which runs on each start of the Docker dev environment as its own one-and-done service. It generates a small set of test data to simplify local testing and development.

## Updates

Additions and updates to [seed-data.js](seed-data.js) are welcome. It's expected that this file will be continously altered to allow for testing most scenarios.
